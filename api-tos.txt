hi!

fftiktok is made by a single developer and is made for use among friends.  i
don't have a legal team or abuse team to be able to investigate malicious
usage, but i do investigate some weird things every now and then.

all i really ask is:
    1. please don't use this for any scams
    2. please don't send me an ungodly amount of requests, the server this runs
      on is tiny
    3. please don't use this to do anything illegal

i do reserve the right to block any browser at any point.  if this happens to
you, you will receive a 403 forbidden error and a message on how to resolve it.

i highly recommend calling the tiktok api yourself, or even running fftiktok 
yourself if you need large-scale usage, as it'll make sure you don't depend
on a service you shouldn't depend on (mine), and you won't ruin other people's
days from large request volumes.

if you use a generic user-agent (you don't customize the one from your request
library), you may be swept up in blocks that aren't your fault.  i highly
recommend setting a user-agent to something descriptibe, preferably with a url
&/or email so i can make sure you aren't doing anything evil.

thank you for using fftiktok!  if you have questions, email me:
