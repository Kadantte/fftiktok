## open source disclaimer

while this service, the core functionality behind fftiktok, is open-source, the
supporting fftiktok-admin service is not. given an uptick in abusive users,
fftiktok-admin was made private to make sure abusers can't just read the code
and get unblocked.

in the future, data will likely be sent to fftiktok-admin containing
information related to your request (ip, user agent, etc.) in order to process
bans more effectively. this is not currently the case. if you wish to opt out
of this, fftiktok itself will always be open-source, and i welcome you to host
your own alternative or call the tiktok api yourself.
